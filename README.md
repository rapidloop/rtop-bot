*rtop-bot* is a bot front-end to *rtop*.

*rtop* can connect over SSH to Linux systems and display their vital system
metrics without needing any agent on the target system. *rtop-bot* can do
this when asked to, over HipChat or Slack. *rtop-bot* is independent of *rtop*.

*rtop-bot* is self-hosted. You can run it on a machine within your
secure network from which it can SSH to target systems. When run, it will
connect to Slack as a bot (or to a HipChat room as the user you specify), and
listen for mentions:

    you     | @rtop-bot status some.host
    rtop-bot| [some.host] up 34d 20h 1m 51s, load 0.08 0.03 0.05, procs 1 running of 131 total
    rtop-bot| [some.host] mem: 45.55 MiB of 489.57 MiB free, swap 0 bytes of 0 bytes free
    rtop-bot| [some.host] fs /: 16.18 GiB of 18.55 GiB free
